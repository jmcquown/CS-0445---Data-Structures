# CS-0445---Data-Structures
Pitt CS 0445 Data Structures (Dr. John Ramirez)

This repository is for the projects that I did exceptionally well on in my Data Structures class.

In order to understand each project please look at the .pdf file in each assignment's folder.
There are also .txt and output files associated with some assignments.

Assignment 1 - Creating the card game "War" in a simple array-based Data Structure.

Assignment 4 - Testing the runtime of Quicksort in relation to pivot value and input size.

Assignment 5 - Implementing different features to a Binary Tree and Binaray Search tree. Such as Building and saving via inorder traversal, checking the properties of both trees (full, balanced, etc.), and getting the max and min values.
